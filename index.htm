<p>The results are significant as they let me recognize what is my merit and demerit. It is more like a mirror, telling me what should I show to others and what should I improve. I will save the results and remind myself all the time that I am not bad, but I still need to be better.</p>

When forming a team. I will do some preparation about what kind of teammates I need, and what occupation they and me need to be in the team, so we will distribute the work properly, reasonably, and efficiently. For example, if We are going to create a Website, a web designer, a content writer, and a programmer are required. If we need to focusing on this task, I need to figure out the team members who are capable for those positions.</p>

<h1 style="background-color:rgb(115, 78, 151) ; color: white">Project Idea</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>he game I would like to design is called League Universe(LU) which game is based on the idea of currently famous game League of (LOL) Legends. I am going to make the champions(the characters in LOL) freely controlled by players in both First-person and Third-person perspectives. On the otherhand, the area that players active is going to be extremely wide(In LOL, players just can choose limit maps and they are not big enough), so players can freely enter different City states and open countries. Not only that, players not only can fight in the sky, but also under water. Overall, FREE is the biggest title of this game.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>It is well-known that LOL is the most popular multiplayer online battle arena(MOBA) game is the world. As there are plenty of players and immense, rich history of each champions. So I believe that create a game that can show the personalities and map features of these champions is significantly charming for very LOL players. On the other side, I have joined a social chat group that contains 2000 people who are also not only attracted by the game itself but also the settings and styles for the game background and characters’ experiences of League of Legends. Thereby, designing such game can be challenging at fulfilling the users’ will as well as putting in all the LOL elements. I would like to see the innovation that more people will make a open-world game such as Warcraft and Sea of Thieves and be tend to portray and develop their favourite characters rather than than how to let the game win.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>Interface and humanization</h3>
<p>To begin with, at the client of login interface, The players can log in with their Riot accounts, thereby all the data and process will be saved to the Riot server. Saving process is executing at anytime, so players will not worry about losing data by accidental disconnections anymore in LU. For the servers, they will be mainly set in Asia, South America, Europe and Oceanica. In terms of the Language, The language will be automatically set up depends on the IP that users log in. However, players can also set the language by themselves.</p>

<h3>Game Operating Environment and online update</h3>
<p>LU can be ran on Windows, Ios, consoles such as PS5, XBOX. Most updates will be executed online, so players will not worry about be forcing to disconnected by regular maintenance.</p>

<h3>Game background and storyline</h3>
<p>Basically, the game is created using the stories of League of Legends. Each champions have their own story - How they become like this, what have they experienced, are they infamous or famous. There will be various areas in LU, such as some famous cities: Bandle City, Bilgewater, Demacia, Freijord, Ionia, Noxus, Piltover,and Zaun. Place name: Blue Flame Island,  Kalamanda, and Howling Marsh, Shurima Desert. </p>
<p>Corresponding plots will happen, relate with the real history when different Champions pass through different areas. Some champions have wonderful experience and some have painful experience. All of these can be chosen before player start playing the game. Once a champion complete corresponding plots or missions, they would learn new skills and abilities. e.g. Yasuo would learn his ultimate ability when his brother Yone is dead. After completing all the main stories of the champion, players are able to go to the new place called Summoner’s Arena where gathering all the PVP players who want to compute and battle with others.</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>I prefer to use common operations rules as normal FPS game. On the keyboard, W is moving forward,A is moving to left, S is moving backward, D is moving to right, pressing shift to make character run, but their are cool down for that. SPACE is jumping up, double clicking space is jumping higher, V is Switching perspective from 3rd to 1st, or 1st to 3rd. Press M to see the whole map of the game, Esc to see settings and quit game option. Using mouse to control the perspective. Right lick is aiming, Left click is shooting or doing basic attack.</p>
<h4>There are three main game modes</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Story: After the players chooses the role, they can enter the offline gameplay- to experience the life of the protagonist, including main line that are important events that affect character’s life to obtain the correspongding skills for afterward-PVP, and also incidents to learn little extra skills</li>
  <li>Adventure(Only available when Story is completed): 3-10 players make a group to complete various difficulty of events to earn golds</li>
  <li>PVP(Only available when Story is completed): Players use their own characters to fight against other players. The winner can get golds and winning points. The higher the winning point, the higher the reward.</li>
</ol> 

<h3>Rules</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Each person can only create one account.</li>
  <li>Logging in to another person’s account is prohibited, otherwise banned from LU for seven days.</li>
  <li>Using third-party software is prohibited, otherwise banned for 30 days, second time ban permanently.</li>

<p>Successful project would attract players who love playing 3a, 3D, MOBA, and FPS games, also fulfill the people who expect the Whole League of Legends elements to become integral-by making a game to introduce each characters. It might be a A fusion of elements that has never happened before due to there are 160 characters in the game and each character has their own personality, habits, and history.
